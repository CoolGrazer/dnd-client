MOTHER 3 Soundtrack

NOTE: These OGG music files were taken from MOTHER 3's sound player using
      a special build of sarsie's Mednafen emulator. The track titles use
      the MOTHER 3 Fan Translation's current titles, but since that project
      isn't complete yet, the final song titles may wind up slightly different
      than what's listed here. But major changes aren't expected, so don't worry. 

      Most good media players these days support the OGG format, but if for some
      reason you're unable to play these files, a good place to look for
      codecs/players for your operating system would be here:

      Also, it appears there are several songs from the game that are missing
      from the sound player. As we find these songs, we'll add them to the
      MOTHER 3 music section at starmen.net, so check there if you're interested.
